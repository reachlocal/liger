# Step 3 Writing a LigerMobile app

We have created a great tutorial where we go through building an HTML LigerMobile app step by step. You will start out with a skeleton app and then piece by piece build it into a fully functioning app. Make sure you have set up your LigerMobile development environment and then head over to the [LigerMobile app tutorial](https://github.com/reachlocal/ligermobile-workshop). The [readme.md](https://github.com/reachlocal/ligermobile-workshop) is a step by step guide and by git cloning the repo you have all the code for all the steps.
